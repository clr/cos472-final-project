Do you want to EXIT - {y/n}? 

WELCOME TO AUTOCLASS.
  1) Each time I have finished a new 'trial', or attempt to find a good
     classification, I will print the number of classes that trial
     started and ended with, such as 9->7.
  2) If that trial results in a duplicate of a previous run, I will print
     'dup' first.
  3) If that trial results in a classification better than any previous, 
     I will print 'best' first.
  4) If more than 30 seconds have passed since the last report, and a new
     classification has been found which is better than any previous ones,
     I will report on that classification and on the status of the search
     so far.
  5) This report will include an estimate of the time it will take to find
     another even better classification, and how much better that will be.
     In addition, I will estimate a lower bound on how long it might take to
     find the very best classification, and how much better that might be.
  6) If you are warned about too much time in overhead, you may want to
     change the parameters n_save, min_save_period, min_report_period, or
     min_checkpoint_period.
  7) To quit searching, type a 'q', hit <return>, and wait.  Otherwise I'll
     go on until I complete trial number (100).
  8) If needed, every 30 minutes I will save the best 2 classifications
     so far to file: 
     /home/clr/cos472/cos472-final-project/spectrometer/lrs.results-bin
     and a description of the search to file:
     /home/clr/cos472/cos472-final-project/spectrometer/lrs.search
  9) A record of this search will be printed to file:
     /home/clr/cos472/cos472-final-project/spectrometer/lrs.log
